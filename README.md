# python-active-tor-after-vpn-
An old short project (coded in 2015). This consists of a server which runs on the vpn server and which enables the routing of all the packets from the vpn through tor. In addition, the control of this server is done by means of a mobile phone application coded in python also (with kivy) and mixing ssl. 

* Put your ssl certificat and its password in the main program
* Put your key file and its password in the main program

I didn't manage to find the latest version of my buildozer/kivy project so you don't have the latest buildozer.spec file which normally includes changing the loading image etc. but I attach you some picture of the last app.
